# Advanced-CSS-Portfolio-Homework-Wk2
First two weeks of instruciton used in completing this homework.
I build a website without the benefit of any starter code from instructors, though I did resuse some code from previous works in class.
The website I built contains several recent photos of me (no more than one year old), as well as pictures of my family and pets. 
I did not spend a lot of time composing paragraphs, nor do I have a current resume to share at the moment.
However, the links work and once I have the documents to attache to it, I shall link them to the site.
A considerable amount of time was spent styling the page: from picking out colors to adding special touches like box shadows and hover element.
I feel that I used most topics covered in class to create the website: from html elements to CSS designs my site incorporates many like live active links;accesibility feature; two types of lists; breaking page into parts; setting parameters for layout; font sizes and colors; rounded corners on images; personalized title tab; resizing responsive design are just to name a few.
I feel that I learned a lot during class that I was not aware of until it came time to utilize those skills in this project.
